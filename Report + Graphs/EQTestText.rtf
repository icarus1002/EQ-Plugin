\f0\fs24 \cf0 EQ Test\
\
In this track, I wanted to try using the EQ on just the melody.  As the track progresses, you can hear me messing with the high and low shelfs, and the peak.  I tried all different combinations, and tried to see how different things sounded when certain parameters were turned up together.}
